## Projects:
* [NASA’s International Space Apps Challenge](https://github.com/heber-augusto/planetaagua/blob/master/data/InterfaceDadosNASA.ipynb):  Using NASA data and using Facebook's Prophet prediction library, found prediction values for level and temperature rise over the next 5 centuries. This prediction was developed in python using the free Google Colab tool;
* [Music generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://github.com/heber-augusto/aws-deepcomposer-samples): This is a colab runnable version for AWS DeepComposer workshop. The notebook and files which were modified are inside Lab 2 folder. This modified version uses a google drive and copy all repository files into it using git clone command;
* [Azure Machine Learning Foundations Course](https://github.com/heber-augusto/udacity-azure-ml-foudations): Notebooks created during Udacity Azure Machine Learning Foudations course (good to compare the work with and without Azure M.L. Studio);
* [Introduction to Machine Learning from Udacity](https://github.com/heber-augusto/udacity-intro-to-ml): A python3 and docker version with projects developed from Introdution to Machine Learning Course from Udacity;
* [Some useful codes used in my data science projects](https://github.com/heber-augusto/datascience-colab-templates): Some colab notebooks containing templates of code to help with datascience projects;
* [end-to-end weather forecast project](https://github.com/heber-augusto/weather-forecast): The goal from this project is to evaluate how temperature and humidity sensors from a data center are good for predicting rain precipitation;
* [notebooks from my master degree](https://github.com/heber-augusto/master-degree-jupyter-notebooks): Jupyter notebooks with concepts and techniques developed during the master´s work "Using machine learning to predict sewage overflow in lift stations". This code is receiving some additional documentation to help undestanding;
* Projects developed during Nanodegree "Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure": 
  * [Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure](https://github.com/heber-augusto/Nanodegree_Azure_ML_Engineer_OptimizingPipeline);
  * [Operationalizing Machine Learning in Azure](https://github.com/heber-augusto/Nanodegree_Azure_ML_Engineer_Operationalizing);
  * [Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning in Azure](https://github.com/heber-augusto/Nanodegree_Azure_ML_Engineer_CapstoneProject).
* Monitor Rosa (conjunto de ferramentas, softwares e outros artefatos cujo principal objetivo é melhorar o cenário de diagnósticos de câncer de mama no Brasil):
  * [Automação da coleta de arquivos do SUS](https://github.com/heber-augusto/devops-pysus-get-files);
  * [Notebooks contendo análises e indicadores criados a partir dos dados do SUS](https://github.com/heber-augusto/sus-kpis-analysis).
